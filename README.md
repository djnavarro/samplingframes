# Sampling frames

This repository contains code associated with the "sampling frames in reasoning" project. It contains three main subdirectories, one containing source code for running experiments associated with the project, another containing the model code, and a third containing the manuscript files

Hayes, Banner, Forrester & Navarro (under review). *Sampling frames and inductive inference with censored evidence.* Manuscript submitted for publication

## Experiments

The experiments folder contains seven directories that include all source files needed to run seven of the nine experiments referred to in the paper

- `frames_E2`, `frames_E3` and `frames_E4` are Experiments 2-4 from the main paper
- `frames_B1`, `frames_B2` and `frames_B3` are the three base rate experiments B1, B2 and B3 discussed in Appendix A
- `frames_S1` is the between-subjects sample size experiment discussed in Appendix A
 
Currently missing are:

- Experiment 1 from the main paper and Experiment A1 from the appendix are missing. They were written using LiveCode and we haven't yet worked out an archiving strategy for these
