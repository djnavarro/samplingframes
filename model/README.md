## Modelling scripts

Code and (somewhat preprocessed) data for the Gaussian process model for inductive reasoning described in:

Hayes, Banner, Forrester & Navarro (in preparation). *Sampling frames and inductive inference.* Manuscript in preparation

In the `source` directory there are several scripts:

- `category.bug` and `property.bug` are the JAGS model files that implement the Gaussian process model with censored sampling
- `simulations.R` runs the JAGS simulations for every condition in the three experiments that we model (E1, E2 and E4), and saves the results to the `output` directory
- `plotsims.R` reads the results of the simulations as well as the human data, and draws two pretty pictures summarising the whole thing 
- `aggregate_experiments.R` reads data from the original CSV files and writes the tidied `human.csv` file
- the various "robustness" scripts (`robustness_E1.R`, `robustness_E2.R`, `robustness_E4.R`, `run_robustness.R` and `aggregate_robustness.R`) run the robustness analysis described in Appendix B. The results are written to timestamped files in the output directory.

In the `data` directory there are five CSV files

- `expt1.csv`, `expt2.csv` etc contain the data from each experiment separately. They've been preprocessed by different people and so they don't have consistent formatting
- `human.csv` is the aggregated version with all data from E1, E2 and E4 in a single data set with consistent naming (and also consistent with the naming used within the modelling) 

In the `output` directory there are three files & three directories:

- `simulations.Rdata` contains the output from simulating the GP model. It contains the `make` function used to construct each simulation, and `sim`, a list that includes each separate condition (14 in total) as an element. See below for a summary of what each of these elements contains
- `fits_lines.pdf` and `fits_scatter.pdf` are the summary pictures showing human and model performance in each condition
- the three `robust` directories contain all the simulation outputs from the robustness simulations.

The elements of a `sim` list (e.g., `sim$category_positive_only`) contain the following elements:

- `opt`: various options governing the JAGS simulations
- `obs`: data (including model parameters) fed to JAGS
- `string`: the JAGS model as a string
- `jagsmod`: the actual JAGS model object
- `samples`: the samples generated by the JAGS run
- `out`: a simple summary used to help draw pictures
